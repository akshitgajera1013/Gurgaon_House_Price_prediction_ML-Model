# Gurgaon_House_Price_prediction_ML-Model
This is a machine learning model that i create with gurgaon dataset of house price prediction. RandomForestRegressor model i used for this ML pipeline.

Here i uploded housing.csv file as my main data set that is use for trainning ML model. you should run test model python file first for create input.csv file as a input data for train model and also this python code will create model.pkl and pipeline.pkl.
After that you should run again test model python file and now you have model.pkl pipeline.pkl and input.csv so at this time this python file will test your data that is in inputr.csv file and give output.csv file as a model predicition.

\\Keep in mind test model python file run two time.\\
